# Ironhack Final Project: Yummest

The goal of Yummest is to help you find the restaurant where your entire meal chosen is the cheapest. 

This application receives individual pictures of each plate of your entire meal. Based on that information provides you the direction to the restaurant where that full meal is cheaper and some other addictional information like the number of calories by plate chosen.
